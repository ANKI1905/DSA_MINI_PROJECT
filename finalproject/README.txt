WORK DESCRIPTION:
I started with what is compression, its types and how it works. And then learnt various compression algorithms like huffmn, lz77, lzw, shano-fano etc. Then I started implementing Huffman algorithm by learning from various sites, youtube, etc. i got the codes for characters and then to write each digit as a bit in file, I learnt the concept of bit masking. So in this way huffman compression was implemented. Aftre this, i started with huffman decompession which was almost reverse process of compression.
After completing with huffman, I started lzw. first learnt algorithm and implemented it.
And then i tried checking my code for various cases like txt files, large files, images, pdf, odt, etc.
It wasnt working for all cases, but through small changes it worked.
This project gave many challenges and also taught many new concepts. It was amazing.
